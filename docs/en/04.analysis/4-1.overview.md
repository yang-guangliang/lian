# Program Analysis Engine

The program analysis engine is the core of the Lian code analysis framework. It is responsible for semantic analyses on GIR intermediate-language code, including control-flow analysis, data-flow analysis, and points-to analysis. It consists of three parts:

- p1: Basic structural analysis: The basic structural analysis module performs static structural analysis on GIR, such as scope hierarchy, module and import relationships, type hierarchy, control flow, and def-use relationships. Its code is mainly in the `basics/` directory.

- p2: Bottom-up semantic analysis: The bottom-up semantic analysis module performs function-level data-flow and points-to relationship analysis, applies callee summaries to caller functions, and generates new data-flow and points-to relationships. Its code mainly includes `core/prelim_semantics.py` and `core/stmt_states.py`.

- p3: Top-down semantic analysis: The top-down semantic analysis module analyzes starting from the entry function and proceeds downward level by level, generating function-level data-flow and points-to relationships. Most of its implementation reuses the bottom-up semantic analysis, mainly including `core/global_semantics.py` and `core/global_stmt_states.py`.
