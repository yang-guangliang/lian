## Memory and File System (Loader)

&emsp;To enhance the management of memory and files, particularly to mitigate memory insufficiency issues, we implemented a two-tier memory management system based on the LRU (Least Recently Used) algorithm, comprising the item layer and the bundle layer. Additionally, the bundle layer facilitates interaction with local hard disk storage, thereby enabling file management.
