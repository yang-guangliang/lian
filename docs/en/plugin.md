## **Plugin System (app_manager)**

&emsp;The unique characteristics of different programming languages require case-specific analysis and handlingâ€”for instance, JavaScript's prototype chain. To ensure the extensibility of the analysis tool, this system incorporates a plugin mechanism. When developers need to add a new plugin, they must first register it in `app_register.py` and `app_manager.py`, prepare the plugin's processing logic, and then trigger the plugin at the appropriate location via `AppManager.notify()`. Once triggered, the plugin returns its output along with its processing status.  

&emsp;Taking a JavaScript prototype chain handler plugin as an example, after registering the plugin and preparing its processing logic, developers trigger it at the appropriate location:  

```python  
...  
event = EventData(  
            # The language to which this plugin applies  
            self.lang,  
            # The phase in which the plugin is invoked  
            EventKind.P2STATE_NEW_OBJECT_BEFORE,  
            {  
            # Input data for the plugin  
                "stmt_id": stmt_id,  
                ...              
            }  
        )  
# Trigger the plugin and retrieve its output and processing status  
app_return = self.app_manager.notify(event)  
# Determine subsequent analysis based on the plugin's processing status  
if event_return.is_event_unprocessed(app_return):  
    ...  
```
